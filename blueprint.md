*   **About Page:** A page that provides more detailed information about the school's mission and vision, accompanied by a relevant image.
*   **Contact Page:** A page that displays the school's contact information (email, phone, address) in a clear and organized manner.
*   **History Page:** A timeline-style page that showcases the school's history and significant milestones in a visually engaging way.
*   **Authentication:** The application now includes user authentication with sign-up, sign-in, and password reset functionality.

## Current Plan & Steps

The current plan was to create a multi-page informational website for a school. The following steps have been completed:

1.  **Project Setup:** Initialized a Next.js project.
2.  **Page Creation:**
    *   Created an `about` page.
    *   Created a `contact` page.
    *   Created a `history` page.
3.  **Navigation:**
    *   Added links to all pages on the home page.
    *   Created a reusable `Header` component for consistent navigation.
    *   Integrated the `Header` into the main application layout.
4.  **Styling and Design:**
    *   Redesigned the home page with a modern layout and "bold" aesthetics.
    *   Redesigned the `about` page with a two-column layout.
    *   Redesigned the `contact` page with a clean and modern look.
    *   Redesigned the `history` page with a vertical timeline.
5.  **Authentication Implementation:**
    *   Added pages for `signin`, `signup`, `forgot-password`, and `reset-password`.
    *   Created API routes for handling user authentication.
    *   Set up the database connection and user models.
6.  **Build Fix:**
    *   Resolved "Module not found" errors during the build process by correcting the import paths in all API route files.
    *   Successfully built the application.
7.  **Finalization:**
    *   Updated this `blueprint.md` file to reflect all changes.
